We wrote this program during Sprint Week #1 (Feb. 28 - Mar 6, 2022) of our Software Development Program at Keyin College.
Project 1 of Sprint Week #1 asked us to create a Python program based on on the claims processing system for employees who take work trips for 
the NL Chocolate Company.
It is a menu-based program that includes 5 options:
1) A program to process Employee Travel Claims.
2) The FizzBuzz Interview Question.
3) Cool things with Strings and Dates.
4) A program to produce a graph based on Monthly Claim Totals.
5) An option to quit the program.

Another parameter was to include two seperate functions at the beginning of the program.
We chose a function to format dollar values, and a function to validate phone numbers.
